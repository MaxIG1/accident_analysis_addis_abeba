# Project Overview

This project contains several Jupyter Notebooks dedicated to different aspects of data analytics related to crash data. Please consult the `Data_Analytics_Pr√§sentation.pdf` (in German) for a comprehensive overview of the project.

## Notebooks

### 1. Data Preparation
- **File**: `Data_Preparation.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook contains all the steps and code necessary to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

### 2. Clustering
- **File**: `Clustering.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook explores clustering techniques. Although the clustering did not yield significant results, the process and methods are documented here.

### 3. Analysis
- **File**: `Analysis.ipynb`
- **Description**: Contains the analysis that yielded good results, providing insights and visualizations based on the prepared data.

### 4. Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- **File**: `Random_Forest.ipynb` and `logistic_regression.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook is mainly used to analyze the deadliness of crashes using Random Forest and Logistic Regression models.
